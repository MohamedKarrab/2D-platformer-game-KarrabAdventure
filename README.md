# 2D-unity-game-KarrabAdventure

This is a simple 2D platformer game I worked on last summer alongside with some other projects,

I dowloaded most of the sprites from the internet, and I created some of them myself using asperite.
My job was mostly coding and creating the game mechanics. (The most fun part was implementing chests and the items bounce and auto follow the player!) 

the game controls are ready for pc as well as mobile devices!
this repository contains the android build! You can enjoy testing the game on your android device without having to build it!

PS+ level 2 is much more polished than level 1 ^_^
